Function written curtesy of Edwin Thoen <edwinthoen@gmail.com>

"[ggsurv] is now part of the GGally package at which it is internally split into two functions, one for 
single and one for multiple strata. I have taken the code for multiple strata and added three parameters 
for size, to adjust the estimate, the CI and the censor points. Attached you will find a script with this code."
